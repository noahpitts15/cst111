<p>And I am very passionate about learning about the global revolution.
One day I predict the McDonalds mascot known as "GRIMACE" will play
a large role in the end of times. I predict that one day "GRIMACE"
will take over the sudanese government and seize control of all their
rhinos. With this, he will begin his plot of world subjugation
using the rhinos to do his bidding globally. Everyone must be prepared.</p>

<p> Pictured: Grimace beginning his agenda of cannibalism, 
minus the subjugation. This is what caused him to devise his plan as
he was at risk for being jailed for his brutal murders. <p>

<h2>Evidence #2:</h2>
<img src="grimacebuthappy.jpg" alt "grimace smiling for his propoganda" 
width="800" height="300" />
<p> Pictured: Grimace in his first attempted 1986 propoganda video
"let me eat you", that still sits in archives, marking the end of the cold
war as both governments agreed he was a much bigger threat. <p>
